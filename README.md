# ICS4U_Sorting

Your job will be to implement *two* of the following sorting algorithms. 
The sorting algorithm should work on any list, and should test each element _lexicographically_ (cast each element to a string before comparing)

* Selection Sort
* Insertion Sort
* [StalinSort](https://www.quora.com/What-is-Stalin-sort)
* Bogosort
* Quicksort
* Merge Sort

Name the functions the sort name but with python convention.
Example:
```
def selection_sort(arr):
  pass
```

Please feel free to use google / stack overflow to look up how these algorithms work, but don't just copy/paste the code...
